<dl>
<dt>How do I access my online course evaluations?</dt>
<dd><p>You can access your evaluations by the following methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="case.evaluationkit.com">case.evaluationkit.com</a> and use your CWRU network ID and password</li>
<li>Go to the <a href="http://www.lmgtfy.com">CWRU site</a> and select the “Course Evaluations”.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>Why can’t I log in?</dt>
<dd>Make sure you are using the correct credentials (CWRU network ID and password). Forgot your password? Visit help.case.edu for more information or <a href="https://its-services.case.edu/my-case-identity/password/reset/">ITS services</a> to reset it.</dd>
<br>
<dt>Why don’t I see all of my courses when I log in?</dt>
<dd>Not all courses are evaluated. You are responsible for evaluating only the courses that show up when you log in during each evaluation period.</dd>
<br>
<dt>Will my answers be lost if I stop in the middle of the evaluation?</dt>
<dd>You have the option to “save and complete later.” Responses you have given will be saved and can be submitted at a later time.</dd>
<br>
<dt>How can my responses be anonymous if I have to log-in?</dt>
<dd>A login is required so that the software can determine the courses you need to evaluate. Instructors are NOT provided access to any names of students. Results are not produced for courses with fewer than 4 completed evaluations.</dd>
<br>
<dt>If responses are confidential, how am I able to receive email reminders that I have not yet completed my course evaluation?</dt>
<dd>The software has the functionality to allow automatic email reminders to be sent to nonresponders at pre-determined intervals.</dd>
<br>
<dt>Will evaluation results be available to faculty before grades are posted?</dt>
<dd>No. Reports will not be available until after final grades are due.</dd>
<br>
<dt>How will I know the online course evaluations are available?</dt>
<dd>Students will receive notifications via an email invitation sent to their university email account.</dd>
<br>
<dt>How can I tell if I have completed all of my evaluations?</dt>
<dd>If you have completed all of your evaluations, EvaluationKIT (wku.evaluationkit.com) will showthat you have no evaluations left to complete once you log in.</dd>
<br>
<dt>Why should I complete my online course evaluations?</dt>
<dd>Your feedback is vital to identifying strengths and weaknesses of courses, programs, and faculty instruction.Completing your course evaluations allows faculty, department heads, and Deans to learn about your experience in the classroom. It is up to you to make the university learning experience the best it can be.</dd>
<br>
<dt>Are course evaluations mandatory?</dt>
<dd>No. However, only students who have completed all of their course evaluations for the semester will receive early access to their grades that faculty have posted via TOPNET prior to the date when all grades are due.</dd>
<br>
<dt>How are the results of course evaluations used?</dt>
<dd>- Faculty are encouraged to use the results in evaluating their own teaching and planning future courses.
Results of course evaluations may be used in both faculty annual performance reviews and the application for promotion and tenure.</dd>
<br>
<dt>I have completed all of my course evaluations. Why can’t I see my grades on TOPNET?</dt>
<dd>There are two possible explanations:
<br>
<ul>
<li>If you can see your course on TopNet and the message “Grade has not yet been submitted”, this just means your instructor has not entered grades into TopNet yet. You will be able to see your grade as soon as it is entered by faculty in TopNet.</li>
<li>If you see this message:<br>
<p>“At this time, access to grades is available only to students who completed all course evaluations by (a completion date will be provided in the pop-up). If you believe you completed all of your evaluations and received this message in error, please contact institutional.research@wku.edu.</p>
<p><strong>All students will receive access to grades on TopNet (a date will be provided in the pop-up).”</strong> Send an email to institutional.research@wku.edu and we will check our respondent files and research why you are marked as a non-respondent.</p></li></ul></dd>
<dt>Who do I contact if I have more questions about the process or if I have difficulty accessing my evaluations?</dt>
<dd>Please contact the Office of Institutional Research (institutional.research@wku.edu or (270) 745-3250) if you have any questions about the process or experience difficulty accessing your evaluations.</dd>
