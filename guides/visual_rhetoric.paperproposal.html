<h1>Occupying Liminal Spaces<br> 
<small>General Electric and a Data Visualization Curative</small></h1></div>

<p>In this paper I will explore the structure of the <cite>General Electric (GE) data visualization blog</cite> <a href="http://visualization.geblogs.com/visualization/records" target="_blank">(http://visualization.geblogs.com/visualization/records/)</a>, and selected representative data sets visualized in that space to illustrate the interplay of influences that add depth to the rhetorical motion of 'charts and graphs'. The inquiry will focus on examples of medical imagery and representations of public health as a nexus of message-making -- who is the audience, what ethical matters are highlighted for the firm, likewise for the providers of data? What role do consumers play in the propagation of these messages? What effect (if any) might the attitude of a sophisticated consumer toward corporate entities have on the message, and how does the firm account for these possibilities?</p>

<blockquote>...data visualization reveals relationships that are fluid, representative and often argumentative...</blockquote>

<p>Inasmuch as we understand that digital data visualization reveals relationships that are fluid, representative and often argumentative -- ultimately informative, we also understand that the rhetorical function of data visualized is as easily evocative, playful, and consciously subversive as non-computational forms. We also understand that corporate entities plan for and react to many factors in the external environment -- political, environmental, social, technological and legal.</p>

<p>And because of the democratizing effect of public data sets and non-expert mediated tools -- from so-called creative coding, to Adobe Creative Suite, to Microsoft Excel -- the practice is both more accessible, and more prone to errors and manipulation.  We've moved beyond the era of infographic to the feelographic, the pathographic. In this paper I will also explore the ways in which an emergent popular understanding of data visualization is fuel for a healthy suspicion of its argumentative function, and a necessary precursor for the artist driven re-visionings of public data that drive innovative methods and design grammar in the 'traditional' arm of data visualization.</p>

<p>The lexical framework of Andrew Galloway (interfacial effects) opens a discussion uni-directional communication and the appearance of 'user control'. Richard Wurman frames topics related to 'adjacency' principles, where user experience (UX) and information architecture (IA) meet. Wurman posits that new information is created by deliberately placing disparate elements in close physical proximity. These diversions, and a brief definition of practioner roles, allow us to reify relationships between practitioner and therorist.</p>

<p>Using the GE blog and data visualizations, I will also explore briefly the impact of data visualization in relation to practical effect on public health, particularly internationally. I will review ethnographic research necessary to achieve consistent messaging across cultural boundaries, or to create tailored messages at a balanced cost. This analysis will serve as a way to forward an argument for the responsibility of capable organizations to act for social good, and ways in which digital data visualization may be best mobilized to serve this responsibility. I will consider the risk of damage to non-tangible assets such as brand equity and goodwill, and attendant mitigation strategies.</p>
