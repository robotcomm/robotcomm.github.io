<p>While each group is created with a specific set of attributes, many of the default settings can be modified by the groupâ€™s manager. These customizable attributes are accessed from the menu appearing on the left side of the group management screen, and are divided into four categories:</p>

<!-- <ul>
	<li><strong>Settings</strong> - controls group appearance and behavior with regard to members</li>
	<li><strong>Permissions</strong> - determines the degree of control a user or role has with regard to group settings</li>
	<li><strong>Roles</strong> - controls settings and permissions for a named class of users</li>
	<li><strong>Information</strong> - controls how the group interacts with mail servers and appears on the web</li>
