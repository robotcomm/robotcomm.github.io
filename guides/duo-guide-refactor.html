*Two-factor authentication* adds a second layer of security to your
online CWRU accounts. Verifying your identity using a *second factor*
(like your phone or other mobile device) prevents anyone but you logging
in, even if they know your password.

 

You'll be able to use two-factor authentication to protect your account
after you've enrolled in Duo using the process below. You'll login as
usual with your CWRU network ID and password, and then use your device
to verify that it's you. You may choose to authenticate via SMS (text
message), voice call, a one-time passcode or the Duo Mobile smartphone app.

*No mobile phone?* You can also use a landline or tablet, or request to
purchase a hardware token. Duo lets you link multiple devices to your
account, so you can use your mobile phone and a landline, a landline and
a hardware token, two different mobile devices, etc.

on your laptop. The appropriate version is available in the Software

the *Case Guest* wireless network.

 1. Launch the Cisco AnyConnect VPN client.
 2. Choose a supported VPN profile from the dropdown menu (supported
    profiles display a second password field.) The *CaseDuo* profile
    grants the same access as the *Case* profile (Figure 11).
 3. Enter your CWRU Network ID and password in the appropriate fields
    (Figure 12).
