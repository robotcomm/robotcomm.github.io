            <p>Identity Finder helps to prevent data loss by finding and protecting sensitive information. When Identity Finder locates confidential data in a file, the program tools can be used to remove the data by securely deleting the whole file or redacting
                data from the file.
                <br>
                <br>
                
<a href="http://www.case.edu/its/policy/ssn-use-policy.html">Data handling policies</a> are in place to protect the interests of university employees, students, affiliates and research subjects. In addition, improper handling of restricted
                information and personally-identifiable information (PII) may place the university at risk of breaching regulatory requirements.
                <br>
                <br>If data files and the restricted information contained within are legitimately required for an approved purpose, contact Information Technology Services (216-368-<strong>HELP</strong>) to discuss secure storage and encryption options.</p>

                <dd>Identity Finder works like an anti-virus product. Client software installs locally, inspects storage media for data matching certain pre-defined criteria, and logs the activity with a management console operated by the Information Security
                    Office. When pattern matches are found (e.g., potential social security numbers, credit card numbers) Identity Finder presents several options to remove the data:
                    <ul>
                        <br>
                        <li>Delete and overwrite the file (Shred)</li>
                        <li>Redact information from the file (Scrub)</li>
                        <li>Prepare the file for move to a secure location (Quarantine)</li>
                        <li>Safeguard the file using proprietary encryption (Secure)</li>
                    </ul>In the case of a 'false positive' match users may also instruct Identity Finder to whitelist a file or location (Ignore).

                <dd>Data incorrectly identified as PII or Restricted Information (e.g., Identity Finder may find a series of random, meaningless numbers in a file that appear in the same format as a credit card or social security number) is known as a ”false
                    positive”.
                    <br>
                    <br>This data does not need to be removed. Use the 'Ignore' action to to allow Identify Finder to ignore false positives or alerts generated by the user's own PII.

                    
<h3 id="quarantine"> </h3>
                </dd><dt>What is 'Quarantine'? <a href="#top"> ^</a></dt>
                <dd>Quarantine moves the file containing PII to a designated folder to be acted upon later. When a location containing PII has been identified but the entire file is absolutely necessary, the Quarantine feature can be used to relocate that
                    data to a separate folder. The 'Quarantine' option should only be used when specifically directed to do so by Information Security or its designated proxy.

                <dd>No. Once you shred it, it is overwritten. You should look closely at data you shred. If you use Carbonite to back up your files, you may be able to recover shredded files, depending on the backup cycle.</dd>
