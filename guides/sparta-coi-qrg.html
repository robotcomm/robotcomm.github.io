<h2 id="preparing-annual">Preparing Annual Disclosures for Certification</h2>



<blockquote>
  <p class="lead">As part of the research community, you are required to submit an annual outside financial interest disclosure form. Your disclosures are reviewed for potential conflict of interest and certified by committee. You must also update your disclosures as they change during the year.</p> 
</blockquote>



<p></p><p><br></p>

<p> You will receive a notification from SPARTA COI by email when disclosure materials are ready for your review. Sign in to SPARTA COI using your CWRU network ID and password to complete the disloser portion of the annual conflict of interest certification process.</p>

<p>Follow the on-screen instructions to submit your materials to the Office of Research Administration for review. Additional next steps will be provided by email, if needed.</p>

<h4 id="before-you-begin-collect-the-following-information">Before you begin, gather the following:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Any consulting agreements you have signed this year </li>
<li>Receipts from travel paid for by outside companies </li>
<li>Any stock option agreements </li>
<li>Your stock portfolio summary </li>
<li>Your current IRS 1040 and 1099 forms </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> you need not complete the process in one sitting. Choose to save your progress and submit the form at a later time if needed. Contact the Office of Research Administration for additional guidance.</p>

<h4 id="managing-individual-disclosures">Managing Individual Disclosures</h4>

<p>You must disclose any financial relationship or interest you hold with a company or external organization. Each organization in which you hold an outside financial interest must be disclosed indvidually. However, multiple occurrences of financial interest with a single organization may be reported using a single disclosure form (e.g., Board of Trsutees and financial benefit from Intellectual Property).</p>

<p>Whether a particular disclosure meets criteria for additional review (i.e., is ‘significant’) is determined systematically. Significant disclosures undergo review by the Office of Research Administration or Office of General Counsel. The Office of Research Administration will notify disclosers of any next needed by email. </p>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> email response, Annual Disclosure form reviewed; no actionable conflict of interest</p>

<pre><code>
To:     
Subject:        COMMITTEE REVIEW COMPLETE: NO ISSUES FOUND
Link:       
Dear  :

Your  Outside Financial Interests Disclosure Form has been reviewed.

Although, you have reported an outside financial interest, it is not considered to be an actionable conflict of interest.  No further follow up is necessary at this time.

Please update your Disclosure Form within 30 days of discovering or acquiring a new outside financial interest, or within 30  days of elimination of a previously disclosed outside financial interest.

At the beginning of each year, you will be asked to complete the annual Disclosure Form again for the entire previous calendar year.

For more information, please reply to the Conflict of Interests Committee staff email caseoic@case.edu or you may contact the Coordinator, Yovonda Rease, by telephone at 216-368-5963.

Thank you for your cooperation!
