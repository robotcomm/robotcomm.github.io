<h2>Account Lockout</h2>
  
<p>If you receive an error message while using your CWRU account with Active Directory (e.g., using a public computer lab with CWRU network ID and password) that states your account has been locked out, <a href="https://its-services.case.edu/my-case-identity/password/change/">sync your CWRU network ID password with your Active Directory password</a>.</p>

<p>Wait 15 minutes and then attempt to log on again. If you are still unable to access your account, contact the ITS Service Desk at 216.368.<strong>HELP</strong> (4357).</p>

<h3>Active Directory account lockout policy</h3>
<p>The Active Directory account lockout policy helps prevent attackers from guessing user passwords, thereby decreasing the likelihood of a successful attack on our network.</p>
<p>If an incorrect account password is entered a specified number of times over a set period (precise conditions are defined by school or department IT administrators), then your account will be temporarily unavailable.</p>
<p>Account lockout will also occur if you are logged into one computer via Active Directory and use a second computer to change your Active Directory password.</p>
