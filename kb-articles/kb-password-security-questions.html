<p>Password security questions are a common form of online account management utilized by banks and businesses. By answering security questions correctly, users are given the chance to change a password that&rsquo;s been forgotten.</p>
<p>As part of its online CWRU Network ID account management process, Information Technology Services requires all users to select and answer a series of security questions at the time that an account is activated. Users are prompted to answer those security questions again to execute a&nbsp;<span class="s2"><a href="https://its-services.case.edu/my-case-identity/password/reset/" target="_blank">Password Reset</a>&nbsp;(</span>if a password is forgotten).</p>
<p>Although password security questions make it convenient for users to re-establish access to an account, using questions with easily guessed answers heighten the risk of breach. Social accounts, blogs, search engine results and news/media resources are all open to malicious actors (e.g., "mother&rsquo;s maiden name" found in social media or search results, birthplaces may be located in searchable government records).</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Use security questions to store extra passwords instead of actual answers to reduce a risk of loss or abuse caused by a breach of CWRU Network account credentials. If you answer these questions honestly, the information may be easily located using social networking tools or Google.</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Passwords used in the place of security question answers should be difficult to guess.&nbsp;To help you remember your passwords, consider using a password management database such as KeePass (<a href="http://keepass.info/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">keepass.info</span></a>).</p>

<h3>Characteristics of an effective password</h3>
  

  
<ul>
<li>At least eight alphanumeric characters long. The suggested length is 12-15 characters.</li>
<li>Is a passphrase. For example, "Ohmy1stubbedmyt0e."</li>
<li>Consists of at least three of these four categories:&nbsp;lowercase letters,&nbsp;UPPERCASE letters,&nbsp;numbers (0-9),&nbsp;punctuation special characters (!@#$%^&amp;*()_+|~-=\`[ ]:";'&lt;&gt;?,./)</li>
<li>Not a word in any language, slang, dialect, jargon, etc.</li>
<li>Not based on personal information, names of family, does not resemble your Network ID, or other information that could be guessed.</li>
<li>Easy for you alone to remember. Use the basis of something you know well, such as a song title, affirmation, or other phrase. For example, the phrase &ldquo;this is my password&rdquo; could be transformed into &ldquo;Th!$!$m/P@&amp;&amp;wrd&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
