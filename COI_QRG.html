<blockquote>
  <p class="lead">As part of the research community, you are required to submit an annual conflict of interest (COI) certification. You must also update your disclosures as they change during the year.</p> 
</blockquote>

<p><br></p>

<p>To complete the discloser portion of the annual COI certification and disclosure process, sign in SPARTA COI with your CWRU Network ID and password. You will receive a notification from SPARTA COI when certification materials are ready for your review.</p>

<p>Follow on-screen instructions to complete and submit your annual COI certification with all appropriate disclosures to the Office of Research Administration for review. Additional next steps will be provided electronically, if necessary.</p>

<h4 id="before-you-begin-collect-the-following-information">Before you begin collect the following information:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Any consulting agreements you have signed this year </li>
<li>Receipts from travel paid by outside companies </li>
<li>Any stock option agreements </li>
<li>Your stock portfolio summary </li>
<li>Your IRS 1040 and/or 1099 forms.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not have all the necessary information to complete the COI form, you may choose to save your progress and submit the form at a later time. Contact the Office of Research Administration for additional guidance.</p>

<h4 id="managing-individual-disclosures">Managing Individual Disclosures</h4>

<p>If you have a financial relationship with a company or external organization, you are required to report the nature of that relationship in a disclosure. You must report information for each organization in its own disclosure. Zero, one or many significant disclosures may accompany your annual certification forms. </p>

<p> Significant disclosures are reviewed by the Office of Research Administration, and may also be eligible for full COI committee review. </p>

<p><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please note that first-time users of SPARTA COI may be required to document disclosures that are retained in the previous COI system. However, once completed, disclosures will carry over year-to-year. </p>
