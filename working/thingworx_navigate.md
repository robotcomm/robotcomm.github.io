## View Design Files  

Use the search function to retrieve ASM and PRT files. To ensure you are returning a result set that contains all applicable files, enter the base part or assembly number with an asterisk before and after the search term.

    
    EXAMPLE: *part_1234*
    

The asterisk is a 'wildcard' character, which means that any search will match any records that contain the supplied search term.


## View Drawing  

Use the search function to retrieve PDF renderings of CAD files. As with *View Design Files* use wildcard characters to ensure your search results contain all possible applicable results.

You may search for a component, or parent part / assembly.

 
## View & Measure in 3D

**View & Measure in 3D** launches [Creo View][3] in a new browser window. Using the Creo View application, users can view and manipulate the 3D representation of the model. This does not make changes to the original.   

    
    Example users of the Creo View application:
    
    * Reliability Engineer - view and manipulate the 3D representation using Creo View to show wetted parts. Screenshot exploded view and annotate for listing packet.
    * Customer Quality (CQI) / Call Center - open to view / rotate / explode product as needed when troubleshooting an install or potential problem.
    *
