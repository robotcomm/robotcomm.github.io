## View Design Files  

Use the search function to retrieve ASM and PRT files. To ensure you are returning a result set that contains all applicable files, enter the base part or assembly number with an asterisk before and after the search term.

    
    EXAMPLE: *part_1234*
    

The asterisk is a 'wildcard' character, which means that any search will match any records that contain the supplied search term.


## View Drawing  

Use the search function to access component drawings directly. As with *View Design Files* use wildcard characters to ensure your search results contain all possible matches.
