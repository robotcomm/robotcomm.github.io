My dear Marketers and Managers, Analysts and Planners, Administrators, HR, Engineers, Innovators, Communicators, Documentarians, and other Proud Product People,

Today is my 941st and final day as an employee of Moen Incorporated. Alas, 941 days is far too short a time to work among such excellent and admirable humans. I don't know half of you as well as I should like, and I like less than half of you as well as you deserve.

And today as I wish you all to fare well, I ask only that you continue to strive together for excellence from whatever chair you occupy, without regard to rank or title, and always with empathy.
