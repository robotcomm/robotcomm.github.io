My dear Marketers and Managers, Analysts and Planners, Admininstrators, HR, Engineers, Innovators, Communicators, and other Proud Product People,

Today is my 941st and final day as an employee of Moen Incorporated. Alas, 941 days is far too short a time to work among such excellent and admirable humans. I don't know half of you as well as I should like, and I like less than half of you as well as you deserve.
