I've added an Excel file that shows the Doc Set / Doc Type schema we'd put together midyear.

Please consult that file for details.

The doc set functionality isn't live in prod. However, you can easily re-enable it and apply it to a list.

All of the infrastructure for DOC Sets and Content Types are configured here: http://moenshare.moen.com/_layouts/15/mngctype.aspx

Filter group to GDP Document Control to review.
