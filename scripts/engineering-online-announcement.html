<h1>Online Engineering Degrees</h1>
<p>The online engineering master’s programs will be developed and operated through a partnership between CWRU and Colloquy. For all student-facing communications, Colloquy refers to its operation as the Online Education Center on behalf of Case Western Reserve University. As such, Colloquy operates and appears to students as a virtual extension of CWRU.</p>

<p>Colloquy (Online Education Center for student-facing communications) delivers an integrated set of services to CWRU including:<br>

<ul>
<li>Market research and marketing outreach for the programs</li>
<li>Enrollment Management - A dedicated team of Admissions Advisors to screen candidates and guide them through the application process to acceptance</li>
<li>Curriculum design and development for all program courses</li>
<li>Management of academic operations - hosting and management of "Learn" (learning management system), and learning management services</li>
<li>Student Success Coordinators who provide "concierge" services to students throughout the program</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Curriculum information and admissions requirements are listed at <a target="_blank" href="http://online-engineering.case.edu/">http://online-engineering.case.edu/</a></p>


<h2>Program Summary</h2>
<p>There are three, 14-week academic semesters per year - Spring (January), Summer (May), Fall (August). Regardless of degree program, students will be offered two concurrent 14-week courses per academic semester.  Programs can be completed in as few as 5 semesters.</p>

<ul>
<li>Master of Engineering - 30 credit hours</li>
<li>Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering - 27 credit hours</li>
<li>Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering - 27 credit hours</li>

<h2>Public Announcement</h2>

Case Western Reserve University launches five all-online engineering master’s degrees 

Case Western Reserve University announces the release of five engineering master’s degree programs entirely online—allowing students to earn one of Case School of Engineering’s industry-recognized, comprehensive degrees remotely.

The online degrees launching in May and August 2015 span five disciplines: Master of Engineering, and Master of Science degrees in biomedical engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering and systems and control engineering. 

The programs are designed for working professionals and can be completed in less than two years. Applications for all programs are being accepted now.

"A master’s degree allows engineers to delve further into the latest breakthroughs in their specific areas of expertise or to enhance leadership skills for career advancement," said Case School of Engineering Dean Jeffrey L. Duerk.

"We understand that not everyone who wants an engineering degree from Case Western Reserve is able to move to Cleveland or wants to put his or her career on hold to do so," he said. "Now, with degrees 100 percent online, students can keep their lives on track wherever they are and learn crucial skills that can significantly advance their careers."

All courses within the online degree programs are taught by the same world-renowned faculty who teach graduate students on campus. With the same in-depth, rigorous content delivered in a convenient online format, students who participate in the online programs receive the same robust education and training as traditional on-campus master’s students.

The Master of Engineering degree program, which begins coursework in May 2015, is a novel, 30-credit, practice-oriented program that allows engineers to enhance critical competencies in business acumen, personal effectiveness in the workplace and technical expertise. The program allows students to choose from four concentrations: mechanical engineering; biomedical engineering; systems and control engineering; and engineering innovation, management and leadership. 

The Master of Science degree in biomedical engineering also begins in May 2015 and addresses a critical need for engineers in one of the fastest-growing professions. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there will be a 62 percent growth in biomedical engineering jobs from 2010 to 2020. Offering the degree program online allows a broader range of students to learn from one of the country’s first departments of biomedical engineering—one that is consistently ranked in the top 15 biomedical engineering programs for graduate studies nationally by U.S. News & World Report.

Also launching in May 2015 is the Master of Science in mechanical engineering—a 27-credit program that delivers the latest in-depth knowledge in some of the most critical areas of mechanical engineering, including fluid mechanics, combustion science, biologically inspired robotics, experimental and computational solid mechanics, biomechanics, bio-manufacturing and engineering for extreme conditions.

The MS degree in civil engineering and MS in systems and control engineering programs will begin in August 2015. The civil engineering master’s degree will prepare students for leadership roles in civil and environmental engineering, and offers a technical concentration in structural engineering. The MS in systems and control engineering takes a holistic approach to solving real-world problems in technology that profoundly impact medicine, arts, sciences, business, law, social behavior and more. Students will explore non-linear control, optimization, signal processing, global modeling and systems biology.
