<h2 id="how-to-escalate">How to Escalate</h2>



<h3 id="description-and-purpose">Description and purpose</h3>

<p>An escalation may be requested by an end user when he or she determines that a critical issue has not been acknowledged properly, remains unresolved for an unacceptable period of time or is severe enough that it requires atypical handling.</p>

<p>Escalation should not be confused with assignment to a resolver group. An escalated issue is typically brought to the attention of management within second-level support.</p>



<h3 id="who-to-contact-for-escalation">Who to contact for escalation</h3>

<p><strong>Stacy Mitchell</strong>, <abbr title="Case email">Email:</abbr> sam57@case.edu, <abbr title="Phone">P:</abbr> (216) 368-0094  </p>

<h3 id="escalation-procedures">Escalation procedures</h3>

<p>SIS is a critical service. Escalations are available whenever requested, including during planned university closures and recognized university holidays.</p>

<p>During unplanned university closures escalations may NOT be available.</p>

<p>Classify the reason for escalation as one of the following; Confirmed Outage (total or partial), Suspected Outage (total or partial), Abend, Slow response time, User Requirements not met, Other functional or Other technical.</p>
