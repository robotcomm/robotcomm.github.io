<h2 id="service-description">Service Description</h2>

<p>CWRU Student Help and Resource Exchange (SHARE) is an application designed to promote undergraduate success. The application provides a common process for reporting behavioral incidents or patterns that may be indicative of future student failure.</p>

<p>Any faculty or staff person with valid Single-Sign On credentials may create a report and submit it CWRU SHARE.</p>

<hr>



<h3 id="use-this-article-when">Use this article when:</h3>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Any faculty or staff person</strong> needs assistance,</p>

<ul><li>accessing CWRU SHARE,</li>
<li>creating or submitting a report,</li>
<li>following up on a previously submitted report record</li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Any faculty or staff person</strong> wishes to direct a comment to the application owner, request features or file a complaint.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Any user</strong> needs to report an application outage</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: CWRU SHARE is a Quickbase application. If for some reason Quickbase is not functioning, CWRU SHARE will also not function.</p>
  
  <p>CWRU SHARE access is determined by LDAP roles and protected with Single-Sign On. A user with multiple affiliations whose primary affiliation ‘student’, or whose primary affiliation has recently changed may not be able to access CWRU SHARE.</p>
  
  <p>Undergraduate students are specifically prohibited from accessing CWRU SHARE via Quickbase or associated database records through any means.</p>

  <p><strong>CWRU SHARE</strong>: Available Mon.-Fri., 8 a.m - 5 p.m., EST. Inquiries placed before 5 p.m. will receive a same-day response. Inquiries placed outside of operating hours will receive a response on the next business day.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Identity Management</strong>: Available as provided in issue-specific script to resolve Identity Management (network credentials, SSO, LDAP, etc.) issues.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-escalate">How to Escalate</h2>



<h3 id="who-to-contact-for-escalation">Who to contact for escalation</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Issue escalation is not offered at this time. All unresolved tickets should be assigned to the <strong>CWRU SHARE</strong> resolver group.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 id="description-and-purpose">Description and purpose</h3>

<p>An escalation may be requested by an end user when he or she determines that a critical issue has not been acknowledged properly, remains unresolved for an unacceptable period of time or is severe enough that it requires atypical handling.</p>

<p>Escalation should not be confused with assignment to a resolver group. An escalated issue is typically brought to the attention of management within a second-level support group(s).</p>



<h3 id="escalation-procedures">Escalation procedures</h3>

<p>CWRU SHARE is not considered a critical service. Issue escalation is not offered at this time.</p>
