<h2 id="how-to-escalate">How to Escalate</h2>
<h3 id="escalation-procedures">Escalation procedures</h3>

<p>www.case.edu is considered a critical service.</p>
<p>Escalations are available whenever requested, including during planned university closures and recognized university holidays. During unplanned university closures escalations MAY not be available.</p>
<p>Classify the reason for escalation as one of the following; <mark>Confirmed Outage (total or partial)</mark>, <mark>Suspected Outage (total or partial)</mark>, <mark>Abend</mark>, <mark>Slow response time (SRT)</mark>, <mark>User Requirements not met</mark>, <mark>Other functional</mark> or <mark>Other technical</mark>.</p>

<h3>Description and purpose</h3>
<p>An escalation may be requested by an end user when he or she determines that a critical issue has not been acknowledged properly, remains unresolved for an unacceptable period of time or is severe enough that it requires atypical handling.</p>
<p>Escalation should not be confused with assignment to a resolver group. An escalated issue is typically brought to the attention of management within a second-level support group(s).</p>

<p>Any official organization within the University is eligible for space on the main campus web server (www.case.edu).

<p>In each case, an Project Inclusion Request (APIR) form must be filled out. This form must be completed by an individual with proper authority; for example, a department chair, the head of an administrative office, or a student group’s faculty advisor. The authorizer must be a full-time member of the Case staff or faculty.</p>
<p>Organizations which are affiliated with the University may be able to obtain space on www.case.edu. In order to do so, the affiliated organization will need to find a department of the University that is willing to sponsor the organization’s inclusion. If a University department withdraws its sponsorship for any reason, the affiliated organization’s material must be removed if another sponsor is not found. Note that all of the affiliated organization’s material housed on the www.case.edu server must comply with the Case Western Reserve University Acceptable Use of Computing and Information Technology Resources policy.</p>
