<h2 id="service-description">Service Description</h2>

<p class="lead">Two-factor authentication enhances the security of user logins when accessing CWRU resources by employing a phone or other connected mobile device as a second method of verifying user identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="lead">Authentication is provided by the vendor, DuoSecurity. ITS has integrated DuoSecurity with VPN service. More services are expected to be integrated with vendor-provided authentication throughout FY15.</p>

<h3 id="description-and-purpose">Description and purpose</h3>

<p>An escalation may be requested by an end user when he or she determines that a critical issue has not been acknowledged properly, remains unresolved for an unacceptable period of time or is severe enough that it requires atypical handling.</p>

<p>Escalation should not be confused with assignment to a resolver group. An escalated issue is typically brought to the attention of management within a second-level support group(s).</p>



<h3 id="escalation-procedures">Escalation procedures</h3>

<p>DuoSecurity two-factor authentication and coordinating VPN profile support is not considered a critical service.</p>

<p>Escalation is available Mon.-Fri., 8 a.m - 5 p.m., EST. Escalations are are not available during planned or unplanned university closures, or during recognized university holidays. </p>

<p>Classify the reason for escalation as one of the following; Confirmed Outage (total or partial), Suspected Outage (total or partial), Abend, Slow response time, User Requirements not met, Other functional or Other technical.  </p>

<li>Multi-factor authentication (also, two-factor authentication, two-step verification, 2FA) provides additional layers of security to protect user data in the case of password theft.</li>
<li>DuoSecurity two-factor authentication enhances the security of your CWRU accounts by using your phone or connected mobile device to verify your identity. This prevents anyone but you from accessing your CWRU accounts, even if they know your password.</li>
<li>CWRU provides two-factor authentication for VPN sessions, and plans to integrate two-factor authentication with other services in the future.</li>
<li>Authentication via DuoSecurity is available to any CWRU user with valid credentials on an opt-in basis.</li>
