<p>AdAstra is the system by which qualified individuals and organizations may request scheduled use of university facilities. All schedule requests, except those requesting use of School of Medicine facilities, are handled by the Office of the Registrar.</p>

<p>The facilities of Case Western Reserve are maintained primarily to serve the needs of the University community for teaching, research, scholarship, and administration. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Refer users to <a href="http://www.case.edu/events/resources/facilitiespolicy.html">Facilities Policy</a> for questions regarding external groups or non-academic use of university facilities (e.g., weddings, funerals, commercial enterprises, student groups).  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regularly scheduled educational programs have absolute priority of use for all facilities. After that, campus facilities are made available in the following order of priority:</p>

<ol>
<li>Official University meetings and conferences</li>
<li>Student activities</li>
<li>Alumni activities</li>
<li>Nonprofit organizations</li>
<li>Other organizations (when event related to university interests)</li>

<h4 id="description-and-purpose">Description and purpose</h4>

<p>An escalation may be requested by an end user when he or she determines that a critical issue has not been acknowledged properly, remains unresolved for an unacceptable period of time or is severe enough that it requires atypical handling.</p>

<p>Escalation should not be confused with assignment to a resolver group. An escalated issue is typically brought to the attention of management within a second-level support group(s).</p>

<h4 id="who-to-contact-for-escalation">Who to contact for escalation</h4>

<ol>
<li><strong>Jeremy Naab</strong>, Jeremy.Naab@case.edu, 216.368.4323 (office)</li>

<li><strong>Jean Seneff</strong>, jean@case.edu, 216.368.3103 (office)</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="escalation-procedures">Escalation procedures</h4>

<p>AdAstra is not considered a critical service.</p>

<p>Escalation is available Mon.-Fri., 8 a.m - 5 p.m., EST. Escalations are are not available during unplanned university closures, or during recognized university holidays. </p>

The instructional, research, service, and administrative requirements of the University take precedence over any other prospective use of University facilities. All space belongs to the University. No space (including classroom, laboratory, or office) belongs to an individual or department. The provisions of this policy apply to all facilities owned or leased by the University.</p>
  
  <p>The University must follow applicable federal and state law to maintain its tax-exempt status. The University reserves the right to withhold from any individual or group the use of University facilities or service when, in the opinion of the University’s officers, such use is not in the best interest of the institution or may place the University in a position of legal liability.</p>
