<h2 id="service-description">Service Description</h2>

<p>Student Information System (SIS) is an administrative database. SIS is the database of record for student information and the university course catalog.  </p>

<p>SIS is available to all enrolled students and all faculty. Staff who support students, faculty, or academic administration should complete a <a href="http://case.edu/registrar/media/caseedu/registrar/documents/forms/sissecurityform.pdf">security form</a> to request access. </p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> A <a href="http://case.edu/registrar/media/caseedu/registrar/documents/forms/sissecurityform.pdf">security form</a> is required for ANY user who needs access to student data. There are three main access points for most campus users:</p>

<ol align="left">
<li><strong>Schedule of Classes</strong> - for departmental users who maintain each term’s course offerings</li>
<li><strong>Department Admin Center</strong> - academic, financial or basic biographical/demographic data (per student basis)</li>
<li><strong>Data Warehouse</strong> - preformatted reports using student data (NOTE: this system resides outside of SIS)</li>

<h2 id="how-to-escalate">How to Escalate</h2>



<h3 id="description-and-purpose">Description and purpose</h3>

<p>An escalation may be requested by an end user when he or she determines that a critical issue has not been acknowledged properly, remains unresolved for an unacceptable period of time or is severe enough that it requires atypical handling.</p>

<p>Escalation should not be confused with assignment to a resolver group. An escalated issue is typically brought to the attention of management within second-level support.</p>



<h3 id="who-to-contact-for-escalation">Who to contact for escalation</h3>

<p><strong>Stacy Mitchell</strong>, <abbr title="Case email">Email:</abbr> sam57@case.edu, <abbr title="Phone">P:</abbr> (216) 368-0094  </p>

<h3 id="escalation-procedures">Escalation procedures</h3>

<p>SIS is a critical service. Escalations are available whenever requested, including during planned university closures and recognized university holidays.</p>

<p>During unplanned university closures escalations may NOT be available.</p>

<p>Classify the reason for escalation as one of the following; Confirmed Outage (total or partial), Suspected Outage (total or partial), Abend, Slow response time, User Requirements not met, Other functional or Other technical.</p>
