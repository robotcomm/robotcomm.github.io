<h2 id="service-description">Service Description</h2>

<p>The Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Science DMZ is a portion of the network, built at or near the campus or laboratory’s local network perimeter that is designed such that the equipment, configuration, and security policies are optimized for high-performance scientific applications rather than for general-purpose business systems or “enterprise” computing.  </p>

<p>A Science DMZ integrates four key concepts:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Architecture explicitly designed for high-performance applications, dedicated to scientific R&amp;D</li>
<li>Dedicated systems for data transfer in support of scientific research, without (or with minimal) hindrance from firewalls</li>
<li>Capability for performance measurement, network testing to characterize network as part of R&amp;D process  </li>
<li>Security policies and enforcement mechanisms tailored for advanced, high performance science environments  </li>
</ol>

<p>The Science DMZ program allows secure, high-speed transfers of research data between researchers at CWRU and collaborators at other research universities. Upgraded equipment is available for purchase. However, upgraded equipment may only be used at locations where 10GE infrastructure has already been installed.  </p>

<h2 id="how-to-escalate">How to Escalate</h2>



<h3 id="description-and-purpose">Description and purpose</h3>

<p>An escalation may be requested by an end user when he or she determines that a critical issue has not been acknowledged properly, remains unresolved for an unacceptable period of time or is severe enough that it requires atypical handling.</p>

<p>Escalation should not be confused with assignment to a resolver group. An escalated issue is typically brought to the attention of management within a second-level support group(s).</p>



<h3 id="escalation-procedures">Escalation procedures</h3>

<p>Support for science DMZ installations is not considered a critical service. Support is available during business hours, Mon.-Fri., 8 a.m - 5 p.m., EST.</p>

<p>Escalation is not available at this time.</p>

<h3 id="how-is-the-science-dmz-funded">How is the Science DMZ funded</h3>

<p>The CWRU Science DMZ implementation has been operational since Summer 2014 and has been funded through the National Science Foundation CC-NIE Award 1340938 (Bielefeld, PI). Additionally, the award permitted CWRU to increase the bandwidth of four research buildings from 1 Gbps to 10 Gbps and to implement a 100 Gbps network link to external research networks.</p>



<h3 id="who-operates-the-science-dmz">Who operates the Science DMZ</h3>

<p>The CWRU Science DMZ is operated by the Case Western Reserve’s Division of Information Technology Services (ITS).</p>



<h3 id="how-is-the-science-dmz-secured">How is the Science DMZ secured</h3>

<p>The CWRU Science DMZ includes dedicated network hardware for data transfer both within CWRU and connections to external networks. The security policies for the CWRU Science DMZ ensure maximum performance and base security. More finely tuned firewalling is done on a case-by-case basis on the networks and also done on individual research hosts, as well. Network performance and security monitoring allows CWRU ITS administrators to respond to and filter security threats as needed.</p>



<h3 id="quick-statistics">Quick statistics</h3>

<p>The core of the network is housed within the University’s Kelvin Smith Library data center and provides 100 Gbps connectivity capacity to Internet2 and OARnet research networks. The High Performance Computing Cluster network was connected in Fall 2014 with 40 Gbps connectivity capacity. The HPCC network integration allows the HPCC high performance shared file storage to be integrated into the Science DMZ and allows future instrument integrations directly to the HPCC. Arista and Juniper networking equipment was selected for the CWRU implementation.</p>
