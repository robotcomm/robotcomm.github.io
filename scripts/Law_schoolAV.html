<h2 id="service-description">Service Description</h2>

<p>Audio Visual services and equipment at the Law School (e.g., SmartBoards, projectors, conference room phones, telepresence units, etc.) are wholly operated and maintained by Law School IT. </p>

<p>Analysts may address questions concerning these services using the standard AV / TEC scripts. However, all issues that are not resolved by the analyst should be assigned to the <strong>Law School AV</strong> resolver group for further investigation. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> DO NOT assign any ticket to MediaVision UNLESS the the incident is symptomatic of a problem with a ‘university-level’ MediaVision service (e.g., Echo360).</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="how-to-escalate">How to Escalate</h2>



<h3 id="description-and-purpose">Description and purpose</h3>

<p>An escalation may be requested by an end user when he or she determines that a critical issue has not been acknowledged properly, remains unresolved for an unacceptable period of time or is severe enough that it requires atypical handling.</p>

<p>Escalation should not be confused with assignment to a resolver group. An escalated issue is typically brought to the attention of management within a second-level support group(s).</p>



<h4 id="who-to-contact-for-escalation">Who to contact for escalation</h4>

<p>All escalations should be marked as such and assigned to the <strong>Law School IT Administration</strong> resolver group. </p>



<h3 id="escalation-procedures">Escalation procedures</h3>

<p>Audio Visual services are not considered critical.</p>

<p>Escalation is available Mon.-Fri., 8 a.m - 5 p.m., EST. Escalations are are not available during or unplanned university closures, or during recognized university holidays.</p>

<p>Classify the reason for escalation as one of the following; Confirmed Outage (total or partial), Suspected Outage (total or partial), Abend, Slow response time, User Requirements not met, Other functional or Other technical.  </p>
