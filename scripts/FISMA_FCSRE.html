<h2 id="how-to-escalate">How to Escalate</h2>



<h3 id="who-to-contact-for-escalation">Who to contact for escalation</h3>

<p>FISMA Compliant Secure Research Environment planning is not considered a critical service. Issues that may in other cases be escalated should be assigned to the <strong>Research Computing</strong> resolver group.</p>



<h3 id="description-and-purpose">Description and purpose</h3>

<p>An escalation may be requested by an end user when he or she determines that a critical issue has not been acknowledged properly, remains unresolved for an unacceptable period of time or is severe enough that it requires atypical handling.</p>

<p>Escalation should not be confused with assignment to a resolver group. An escalated issue is typically brought to the attention of management within a second-level support group(s).</p>



<h3 id="escalation-procedures">Escalation procedures</h3>

<p>Escalation is not available at this time. Assign all unresolved issues to the <strong>Research Computing</strong> resolver group.</p>

  <p>FCSRE is important to CWRU for tactical and strategic reasons.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Tactical</strong> <br>
  Data containing personal identifiers, including clinical data from affiliated hospitals, is used in research by CWRU faculty, instructors and students. This data needs to be protected as required in federal and state regulations.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Strategic</strong> <br>
  A fully-FISMA compliant research environment provides competitive advantage to CWRU researchers seeking funding through grants and contracts. <br>
