<li><strong>Mike Warfe</strong>, (216) 368-5647 (office)</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="description-and-purpose">Description and purpose</h3>

<p>An escalation may be requested by an end user when he or she determines that a critical issue has not been acknowledged properly, remains unresolved for an unacceptable period of time or is severe enough that it requires atypical handling.</p>

<p>Escalation should not be confused with assignment to a resolver group. An escalated issue is typically brought to the attention of management within a second-level support group(s).</p>



<h3 id="escalation-procedures">Escalation procedures</h3>

<p>Research Computing is not considered a critical service.</p>

<p>Escalation is available Mon.-Fri., 8 a.m - 5 p.m., EST. Escalations are are not available during or unplanned university closures, or during recognized university holidays.</p>

<p>Classify the reason for escalation as one of the following; Confirmed Outage (total or partial), Suspected Outage (total or partial), Abend, Slow response time, User Requirements not met, Other functional or Other technical.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If essential research or job function(s) are impaired due to an outage, follow critical service protocol. Use <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/case.edu/hpc-upgraded-cluster/hpcc-training">published schedule and contact information</a> to route P0 and P1 incidents to the appropriate resolver group and current Ops Manager On Call.</p>
