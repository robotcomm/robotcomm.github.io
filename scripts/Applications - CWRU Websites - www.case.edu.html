<h2 id="how-to-escalate">How to Escalate</h2>

<h4 id="description-and-purpose">Description and purpose</h4>

<p>An escalation may be requested by an end user when he or she determines that a critical issue has not been acknowledged properly, remains unresolved for an unacceptable period of time or is severe enough that it requires atypical handling.</p>

<p>Escalation should not be confused with assignment to a resolver group. An escalated issue is typically brought to the attention of management within a second-level support group(s).</p>

<h4 id="escalation-procedures">Escalation procedures</h4>

<p>Use <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/case.edu/opsmgr/home">published schedule and contact information</a> to route P0 and P1 incidents to the appropriate resolver group and current Ops Manager On Call . </p>

  <p><strong>Elegibility policy</strong>  <br>
  Any official organization within the University is eligible for space on the main campus web server (www.case.edu). This includes, but is not necessarily restricted to, administrative departments and offices, academic departments, student organizations, Greek organizations, housing councils, and research groups.</p>
  
  <p>In each case, an Project Inclusion Request (APIR) form must be filled out. This form must be completed by an individual with proper authority; for example, a department chair, the head of an administrative office, or a student group’s faculty advisor. The authorizer must be a full-time member of the Case staff or faculty. </p>
  
  <p>Organizations which are affiliated with the University may be able to obtain space on <a href="https://www.case.edu">www.case.edu</a>. In order to do so, the affiliated organization will need to find a department of the University that is willing to sponsor the organization’s inclusion. If a University department withdraws its sponsorship for any reason, the affiliated organization’s material must be removed if another sponsor is not found. Note that all of the affiliated organization’s material housed on the <a href="https://www.case.edu">www.case.edu</a> server must comply with the Case Western Reserve University Acceptable Use of Computing and Information Technology Resources policy.</p>
