<pre><code>
On July 14, 2015, Windows Server 2003 will reach the end of its support lifecycle. After this date, Microsoft will no longer provide security updates for the operating system.

If you are the owner of a Server 2003 machine outside of the ITS Data Center, you should take steps to upgrade, migrate or decommission your machine prior to July 14, 2015. Alternatively, you may remove your machine from the university network. More information regarding Server 2003, inlcuding migration materials, are available at microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/windows-server-2003/.

Effective Aug. 15, 2015, Server 2003 systems will not be compliant with Tier III Information Security controls. Non-compliance with Tier I controls will occur Sept. 15, 2015. By Sept. 15, owners of Server 2003 systems outside of the ITS data center must remove the machine from the university network. For more information regarding these controls, consult Case Western Reserve University’s information security policies at case.edu/its/its-policies/iii-1c-tier-i-controls--protecting-public-information/.

Case Western Reserve University’s training partner, lynda.com, offers several courses regarding the installation and configuration of Windows Server 2012. To watch these videos, navigate to CWRU’s lynda.com portal and type "Windows Server" into the searchfield.
