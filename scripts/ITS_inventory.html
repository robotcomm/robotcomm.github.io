<p><strong>Inventoried Items</strong> <br>
The Inventory includes currently assigned personal computing hardware (desktops, laptops) within its useful lifecycle, docking stations, monitors and mobile devices (excluding cell phones). Newly acquired hardware is added to the inventory during the receiving process.</p>

<p>Personally owned equipment of any kind is not included in the Inventory. Software (regardless of license) is not included in the Inventory. Mobile phones, cabling, and peripherals / accessories (e.g., external hard drives, stands, wireless mice / keyboards) are also not inventoried.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-escalate">How to Escalate</h2>



<h3 id="description-and-purpose">Description and purpose</h3>

<p>An escalation may be requested by an end user when he or she determines that a critical issue has not been acknowledged properly, remains unresolved for an unacceptable period of time or is severe enough that it requires atypical handling.</p>

<p>Escalation should not be confused with assignment to a resolver group. An escalated issue is typically brought to the attention of management within a second-level support group(s).</p>



<h3 id="who-to-contact-for-escalation">Who to contact for escalation</h3>

<p>Escalation available for procedural matters only. </p>

<p><strong>Paul Kalanish</strong>; Paul.Kalanish@case.edu, 216.368.5911 (office)</p>



<h3 id="escalation-procedures">Escalation procedures</h3>

<p><strong>ITS Inventory Process</strong> is not considered a critical service. Escalations are allowed during business hours.</p>
