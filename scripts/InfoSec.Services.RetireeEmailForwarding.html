<h2 id="service-description"><a name="description"> </a> Service Description</h2>

<p>Electronic communication services, including Case Western Reserve email accounts, are maintained primarily to serve the needs of the University community for teaching, research, scholarship and administration.</p>

<p>Qualifying retirees may elect to have email forwarded from a university-owned email account to a personal email account of his or her choosing. Retiree accounts,</p>

<ul>
<li>will not provide functional access to any university systems,</li>
<li>may not be construed to imply permissible use of any university system, and</li>
<li>must be requested through Human Resources, Benefits Administration.</li>
</ul>

<p>Email forwarding accounts may be renewed annually through the Benefits Administration. The university may choose to suspend email forwarding service or individual forwarding accounts at any time, at its discretion.</p>

<p>Users with detailed policy questions should refer to the university <a href="http://www.case.edu/its/policy/acceptable-use-policy.html">Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</a>. Please remember that the AUP applies to all faculty, staff, students, alumni, guests, external individuals or organizations and individuals accessing external network services via university facilities.</p>

<h4 id="description-and-purpose">Description and purpose</h4>

<p>An escalation may be requested by an end user when he or she determines that a critical issue has not been acknowledged properly, remains unresolved for an unacceptable period of time or is severe enough that it requires atypical handling.</p>

<p>Escalation should not be confused with assignment to a resolver group. An escalated issue is typically brought to the attention of management within a second-level support group(s).</p>
