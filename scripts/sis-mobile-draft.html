<h2>Public Announcement</h2>
<div class="well">
<p>We are excited to announce that we have implemented the HighPoint mobile solution for the Student Information System.  As many of you know we have been looking for a mobile solution for a while and with the support of ITS and the entire ERP Team we were able to move forward.</p>  
<p>This will be a phased implementation with the first phase being a soft roll out with view only screens for the Fall semester.  A more detailed roll out schedule will be shared shortly.</p>
