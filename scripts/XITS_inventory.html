<h2 id="service-description">Service Description</h2>

<p>The ITS Inventory process (Inventory) is the process by which ITS describes and catalogs its personal computing hardware resources. </p>

<p>The Inventory includes currently assigned hardware that within its useful lifecycle, newly acquired hardware, peripherals (e.g., secondary monitors, external drives, etc.), accessories (e.g., cabling, stands, wireless input devices, etc.), network appliances and mobile devices. </p>

<p>Personally owned equipment of any kind is not included in the Inventory. Software (regardless of license) is not included in the Inventory. </p>

<p>Requests to assign spares from the Inventory, enter new equipment into the Inventory or complete hardware refreshes are fulfilled by DSS during general business hours only.</p>

<p>Requests to retrieve employee equipment due to termination or resignation are fulfilled by DSS during general business hours only, unless a manager, leadership or HR determines that the matter is critical / urgent.</p>

<h3 id="description-and-purpose">Description and purpose</h3>

<p>An escalation may be requested by an end user when he or she determines that a critical issue has not been acknowledged properly, remains unresolved for an unacceptable period of time or is severe enough that it requires atypical handling.</p>

<p>Escalation should not be confused with assignment to a resolver group. An escalated issue is typically brought to the attention of management within a second-level support group(s).</p>

<p>Escalation is not available for this service.</p>
