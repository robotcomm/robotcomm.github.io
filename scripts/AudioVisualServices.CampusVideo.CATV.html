<h2 id="service-description"><a name="description"> </a> Service Description</h2>

<p>CWRU offers digital cable television (CATV) to all residential and Greek students. Service is provided by Campus Televideo and Time Warner Cable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to receive cable television services, you must have a digital QAM tuner. Digital tuners have been required in televisions since 2007, but not all televisions included the QAM tuner. Converter boxes that can tune digital cable TV signals are available for sale at many retail outlets.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-escalate">How to Escalate</h2>

<h4 id="description-and-purpose">Description and purpose</h4>

<p>An escalation may be requested by an end user when he or she determines that a critical issue has not been acknowledged properly, remains unresolved for an unacceptable period of time or is severe enough that it requires atypical handling.</p>

<p>Escalation should not be confused with assignment to a resolver group. An escalated issue is typically brought to the attention of management within a second-level support group(s).</p>

<h4 id="who-to-contact-for-escalation">Who to contact for escalation</h4>

<ol>
<li><strong>Student Affairs IT</strong><span>, <span id="gc-number-0" class="gc-cs-link" title="Call with Google Voice">(216) 368-1959</span> (office)</span></li>
<li><strong>Joel Kraft</strong><span>, <span id="gc-number-1" class="gc-cs-link" title="Call with Google Voice">(216) 687-6489</span> (mobile)</span></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="escalation-procedures">Escalation procedures</h4>

<p>Although cable television is not considered a critical service, global outages are treated as critical events.</p>

<p>Classify the reason for escalation as one of the following; Confirmed Outage (total or partial), Suspected Outage (total or partial), Abend, Slow response time, User Requirements not met, Other functional or Other technical.  </p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Event type</th>
  <th>Requirements</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
  <td>Critical outage</td>
  <td>one entire group of residence halls or more</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Non-critical outage</td>
  <td>single channel outage, when there is also a major broadcast event</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Other / Isolated events</td>
  <td>service interruption of one or more channels affecting single building / room / floor</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>


<p><strong>Critical outages</strong> <br>
Escalations are available whenever requested, including during planned university closures and recognized university holidays. </p>

<p>During unplanned university closures escalations may NOT be available. </p>

<li>Check Footprints for related incidents of outage at user’s location.</li>
<li>Coaxial cable should be connected firmly to both television and faceplate coaxial cable outlet, and at least finger tight at both ends.</li>
<li>Is television compatible with CWRU cable network (e.g., contains QAM digital tuner)? See, <strong>How-To &gt; Compatibility requirements</strong>.</li>
