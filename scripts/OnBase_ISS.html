<h1>OnBase International Student Services</h1>
<p>OnBase is an Enterprise Document Management (EDM) system. </p>

<p>Separate installations (instances) of OnBase are configured to meet the needs of distinct customer groups. We call these groups called ‘tenants’. Although a tenant may include several functional groups or offices, it will be supported by at most two resolver groups. </p>

<p>One resolver group is made up of individuals embedded within the tenant organization. This resolver handles non-generalized application issues (often related to tenant-specific configuration), advanced troubleshooting, account setup, etc.</p>

<p>The second resolver group, EDocM, is located within central ITS. Any issue that is not resolved by a tenant-specific resolver, or which affects multiple tenants is assigned to EDocM. EDocM may communicate directly with the vendor, Hyland Software.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-escalate">How to Escalate</h2>

<h3 id="escalation-procedures">Escalation procedures</h3>

<p><strong>Document Management</strong> is not considered a critical service.</p>

<p>Escalation is available Mon.-Fri., 8 a.m - 5 p.m., EST. Escalations are are not available during planned or unplanned university closures, or during recognized university holidays. </p>

<p>Classify the reason for escalation as one of the following; Confirmed Outage (total or partial), Suspected Outage (total or partial), Abend, Slow response time, User Requirements not met, Other functional or Other technical.  </p>

<h3 id="who-to-contact-for-escalation">Who to contact for escalation</h3>

<p>Alec Jacubitis, afj14@case.edu, (216) 368-2517<br>
Marielena Maggio, mxm346@case.edu, (216) 368-2517</p>

<h3 id="description-and-purpose">Description and purpose</h3>

<p>An escalation may be requested by an end user when he or she determines that a critical issue has not been acknowledged properly, remains unresolved for an unacceptable period of time or is severe enough that it requires atypical handling.</p>

<p>Escalation should not be confused with assignment to a resolver group. An escalated issue is typically brought to the attention of management within a second-level support group(s).</p>

<div class="well">
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If essential research or job function(s) are impaired due to an outage, follow critical service protocol.</p>
