<h2 id="how-to-escalate">How to Escalate</h2>



<h3 id="description-and-purpose">Description and purpose</h3>

<p>An escalation may be requested by an end user when he or she determines that a critical issue has not been acknowledged properly, remains unresolved for an unacceptable period of time or is severe enough that it requires atypical handling.</p>

<p>Escalation should not be confused with assignment to a resolver group. An escalated issue is typically brought to the attention of management within a second-level support group(s).</p>



<h3 id="who-to-contact-for-escalation">Who to contact for escalation</h3>

<p>All escalations should be marked as such and assigned to the <strong>CSE IT</strong> resolver group. </p>



<h3 id="escalation-procedures">Escalation procedures</h3>

<p>Network support at the Case School of Engineering is not considered critical, except when a failure may impact essential research or job functions within the school.</p>

<p>Escalation is available Mon.-Fri., 8 a.m - 5 p.m., EST. Escalations are not available during planned or unplanned university closures, or during recognized university holidays.</p>

<p>Classify the reason for escalation as one of the following; Confirmed Outage (total or partial), Suspected Outage (total or partial), Abend, Slow response time, User Requirements not met, Other functional or Other technical.  </p>
