<h3 id="who-to-contact-for-escalation">Who to contact for escalation</h3>

<p>FISMA Compliant Secure Research Environment planning is not considered a critical service. Issues that may in other cases be escalated should be assigned to the <strong>SRE Admin</strong> resolver group.</p>



<h3 id="description-and-purpose">Description and purpose</h3>

<p>An escalation may be requested by an end user when he or she determines that a critical issue has not been acknowledged properly, remains unresolved for an unacceptable period of time or is severe enough that it requires atypical handling.</p>

<p>Escalation should not be confused with assignment to a resolver group. An escalated issue is typically brought to the attention of management within a second-level support group(s).</p>



<h3 id="escalation-procedures">Escalation procedures</h3>

<p>Escalation is not available at this time. Assign all unresolved issues to the <strong>SRE Admin</strong> resolver group.</p>
